# co2_emission
This project is focused on predicting COâ‚‚ emissions of vehicles using different machine learning models. The goal is to analyze how various factors such as engine size, fuel type, number of cylinders, and vehicle weight affect carbon emissions, and then build models to make accurate predictions.
